<=================================== Solution ==================================>

## Understanding the problem  

The input is given to us in the form of an array and we need to return its reverse array as the output.

## Approach 1

To solve this I used the in-built reverse() function that can be performed on arrays and then I returned the reversed array.

Time complexity: O(n), where n is the size of the array, and also scales linearly with the size of an array.
Space complexity:O(1), since no new memory is used to create an aray.
